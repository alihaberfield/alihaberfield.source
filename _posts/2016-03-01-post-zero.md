  This was built with Jekyll, mixing the pre-rolled styles with some [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and some customized CSS. 

  An interesting artefect noticed in the process of composing this first post: given a post date of today's date, and a timestamp of the current time, the autobuild fails to generate the post.

With this complete date & timestamp, the post fails to build:

{% highlight yaml %} 
   date:   2016-04-07 16:35:11 
{% endhighlight %} 

If I remove the timestamp, or if I set the date to yesterday but leave the timestamp intact, it builds as expected. These both build:

{% highlight yaml %} 
  date:   2016-04-06 16:35:11
  date:   2016-04-07
{% endhighlight %} 

Curious.
