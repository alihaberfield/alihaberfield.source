intro: |
  I'm a Stockholm-based web developer, originally from Australia. 

  I build web-based services using Rails & front-end, among other things. I've been working as a web developer since 2009. I like to connect with my tech community through meet-ups, Twitter & code mentoring.
history: >
  I started web programming as a highschool hobby in the 90's, when Geocities ruled the earth, tables held everything together and scrolling news tickers were a hot thing. Things have changed a little since then.
